# Postman Clone using React JS

In this project I had Built a REST API based UI (similar to postman) to make HTTP calls

## Key Features
- supports HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- takes a valid URL
- Has the Ability to set/send HTTP headers
- Has the Ability to set/send Json body as payload
- Has a send button which calls the REST API, and display the response status and response body

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sahebcse/Postman-Clone-ReactJS.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Postman-Clone-ReactJS

# Go into the client folder
$ cd client

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
